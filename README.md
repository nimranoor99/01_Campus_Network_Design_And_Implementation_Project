**Description:** 
<br>
This repository contains the files for a campus network design and implementation project created using Packet Tracer. The project includes:
<br>
* Packet Tracer Project File (.pkt): The main Packet Tracer file for the designed campus network.
* Report (File Format: .pdf): A comprehensive report detailing the design process, network components, configurations, and testing procedures.
* Screenshots: Images capturing key aspects of the designed network topology and configurations.
<br>

**Additional Notes:**
<br>
This project demonstrates that a standard network system can be designed with enhanced security while minimizing costs. The network architecture comprises several interconnected components, including a dedicated Telephone Room equipped with VoIP and IP phones. By utilizing cost-effective devices, we have achieved a network solution that employs EIGRP and RIP routing protocols. Essential servers like DNS and DHCP ensure seamless network operations. In simulated testing, data transmission efficiency exceeded expectations, with a loss rate of approximately 15% as anticipated. This network design is not exclusive to developing countries; developed nations seeking to optimize network costs can also benefit from the methodologies employed in this project.
